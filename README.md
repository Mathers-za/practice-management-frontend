Project Title
Practice management applcation bulit to make the useres (helathcare providers) adminstartive tasks easier and more streamlined.
Running a private helathcare practice is hard, but with this practice managent applcation that ive built, it just got a whole lot easier.
Description
Before the big inetrnet boom, helat are providers relied on paper based administarive systems to track patient, appoitnment and  financial data. Fast forward to the present, and you will still find many hleathcare prviders using this method. My aim was to create an easy to use and free practice management system that anyone could use, allowing them to spend more time treating patients sintead of dealing with paperwork. The applcation allows users(hleathcare providers) to create patients, create appointments sfor patients and bill them for those appointments directly through the application either through invices sent to thier medical aid or through invoices sent to thier personal email addresses. Payments can be made and tracked for each appointment, as well as invoices. The invoices template that i have cerated on the backend meets teh instudtry required standard by medical aids in order for successful reimberment to the hl;eathcare provider. With each appoitnment creaetion, the user has the abilty to send ocnfrmationa and reminder emails reuslting in higher appoitnment attendace rates.
