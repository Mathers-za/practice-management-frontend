# Project Title
A practice management application built for healthcare providers to streamline their patient management and financial administrative tasks.

## Description

This application is suited for healthcare providers looking to move away from paper-based filing systems or simply those seeking a more user-friendly and straightforward practice management application.

The application allows users (healthcare providers) to create their own profiles, create new patients, and create appointments for these patients. Payments for these appointments can also be managed.

To maximize patient follow-up rates, users have the ability to choose whether they would like to send email notifications through the application. Users can also customize these emails if they wish.

Invoices for each appointment can be generated and sent via email in PDF format to the patient or their medical aid.

Appointment, patient, and financial data have multiple pages within the application that provide easy visualization for users to track their data.
